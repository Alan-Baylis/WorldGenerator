# WorldGenerator

Another Unity tutorial by Sebastian Lague. 
Covers creating noise maps using Perlin Noise to generate height maps which are then used to modify the vertices of the terrain,
creating peaks and valleys. Implements level of detail so that objects that are further away require less resources to render.
